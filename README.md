# ip_lookup

This is a simple python script that goes through and pulls ip address info for gateways, local, public, and network card adapters.
It also list the currect logged in user and the systems name.

Works on Windows 10 and Kali. If you have to make any modifications to make it work on anther os please let me. I would like to update the code
to work in as many places as possible. I will make a seperate script for os's that I am not able to include adjustments for in the main code.
